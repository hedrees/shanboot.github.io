<p><b><font face="Arial" color="#800000" size="4">Vitamins:</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Is an organic compound and a vital nutrient that an 
organism requires in limited amounts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;An organic chemical compound (or related set of 
compounds) is called a vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound 
in sufficient quantities, and it must be obtained through the diet; thus, the 
term &quot;vitamin&quot; is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular 
organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for 
humans, but not for most other animal organisms. Supplementation is important 
for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of 
nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.<br>
