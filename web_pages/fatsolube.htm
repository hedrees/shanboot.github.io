<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Fat Soluble (vitamins A, D, E 
and K):</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The fat soluble vitamins are soluble in lipids (fats). 
These vitamins are usually absorbed in fat globules (called chylomicrons) that 
travel through the lymphatic system of the small intestines and into the general 
blood circulation within the body. These fat soluble vitamins, especially 
vitamins A and E, are then stored in body tissues.<br>
<br>
Fat soluble vitamins, once they have been stored in tissues in the body, tend to 
remain there. This means that if a person takes in too much of a fat soluble 
vitamin, over time they can have too much of that vitamin present in their body, 
a potentially dangerous condition called hypervitaminosis (literally, too much 
vitamin in the body).<br>
<br>
Persons can be also be deficient in the fat soluble vitamins if their fat intake 
is too low or if their fat absorption is compromised, for example, by certain 
drugs (that interfere with the absorption of fat from the intestine) or by 
certain diseases such as cystic fibrosis (in which there is a deficiency of 
enzymes from the pancreas which similarly interferes with the absorption of fat 
from the intestine).</font></p>
